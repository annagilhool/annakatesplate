        <p>January, February, and the first few weeks of March 2020 I had the opportunity to study abroad in Madrid at IE University. The university is located in Salamanca — an upscale district with designer stores and a plethora of restaurants. During breaks in my schedule I always (as in the barista knew me) headed to my favorite coffee shop, WayCup, seconds from my classes. I didn’t start drinking coffee until I had a cappuccino from here. But, even better than the coffee are the cookies! The baristas warm your cookie for you, so you get a delicious snack with your pick-me-up. My favorite flavors are the peanut butter and carrot cake. There is plenty seating for studying or just chatting with friends. Quiero cookies.</p>

        <p>My other go-to coffee shop was Religion. It is much smaller (so I recommend going solo or with one other friend if you plan to dine in), but young and trendy. When you walk in you see a neon sign lighting up “Coffee is my God” and a pastry case displaying protein balls, bagels, and croissants. When I only had a 20 minutes in between classes I’d run in a get the salmon bagel. Highly recommend! If you are planning on studying here make sure it’s only for an hour — the wifi has a time limit.</p>
